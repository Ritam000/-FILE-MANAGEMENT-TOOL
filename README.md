This C++ file management code shows how to use the C++ Standard Library to carry out simple file operations. It was created in Visual Studio Code, uses the necessary libraries and has a straightforward menu-driven logic. It works best as instructional materials, utility tools, and system applications for novices. It is a stepping stone to more complex C++ projects because of its structure and logic, which provide a fundamental understanding of both console I/O and file handling.
